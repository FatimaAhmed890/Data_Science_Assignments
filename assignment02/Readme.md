# This is a python implementation for the classic Hangman Game.

To play the game import the folder into your localmachine and simply run the command: 
python run.py(for Windows users) or python3 run.py(for Linux/mac users) and enjoy playing :)

(P.S to have some extra fun remove the un-commented word_list from words.py file and un-comment the commented word_list and enjoy!)
